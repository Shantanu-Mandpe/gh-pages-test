	{Application for Internship Opportunity }	
	{Respected Recruiting Manager,}
	{My name is Shantanu Mandpe. I am currently studying at HAW Hamburg, Bsc. Information Engineering Program and I just completed my 4th Semester. I am writing to express my interest to work in an esteemed company like Rohde & Schwarz  for an internship, for the mandatory practical semester of my course. This internship will play a crucial role in my career as I will gain confidence by applying my knowledge and gaining practical experience.   \\
	
	My degree has an emphasis in information and Electrical Engineering, but I also have knowledge in  Project Management and Software Engineering, that I learned via a few of the courses that the University Offered. Along with the university courses, I have also completed online courses for learning Web Development, Python and I also have a rudimentary understanding of git. I am currently learning about Java RMI and distributed patterns as well as SQL, which I am learning in my Software Engineering and Databases Lectures respectively. In Software Engineering course I have also studied about software development processes (including classical and agile, prototyping and DSDM roles) as well as other aspects of Project Management and Software Engineering. 
	
	I have experience working with Simulation Programs like MATLAB, ModelSim and LTSpice. I have also worked with micro-controllers. Currently, I am learning more about Embedded C and VHDL while working with micro-controllers.  \\
	
	My academic accomplishments are very good. I currently have a 1.8 Grade in all coursework and had a 1.7 Grade in First Year of BTech Computer Science course I did before joining HAW Hamburg. I work well in multi-cultured team environments. I have also served as a team leader for various labs and projects I have done during my time at the university. I pride myself in being a quick learner and having good analytical and logical skills. These traits will surely transfer to your internship position and make a noticeable contribution to the company Name.\\

	Thank you for reviewing my background in consideration for your internship opportunity. I would be encouraged to have the opportunity to meet with you to discuss more details of my coursework and other experiences relative to your position and company.	\\

		}
	{Sincerely yours}
